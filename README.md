# Study Formatter

Study Formatter is a python project created assist me in note-taking when reading PDF textbooks. The first function of the program is to clean the text copied from a PDF (removing white space, hypenated words, etc.) to paste into note taking applications. The second function is to format the notes created from my Notion notes into a form that Quizlet's automatic note creation tool prefers. All the notes are pasted together into the notes.txt file and are converted like the following:
